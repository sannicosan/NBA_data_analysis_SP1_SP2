1. Challenges:
   1. Getting familiar to the NBA API itself. 
      1. A lot of investigation about the calls to the endpoints, selecting the right endpoints/tables.
      2. The time that took making these calls and extract the data (when testing, this got tricky because at the beginning it was try&error and thus consumed a lot of time).
   2. Converting the ‘Age’ to the desired format ( manipulation of the datetime library)
   3. The Bonus track (map): difficult to implement -> we are still investigating though.
   4. Achieving the dimensiones required for the test too: we frequently find new inconsistencies due to the criterion each of the members used to filter/extract the proper data. 
2. Take-aways: 
   1. The power of using the apply+lambda & how easy, readable and short it is when coding.  
   2. Data extraction from a Public API.
   3. Google/StackOverflow are your friends!!
      1. Not only for solution, they also teach you best and efficient coding practices




Note: We all still working on the project.
